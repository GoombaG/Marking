# Building the Program

## Go
Install go following the instructions listed here: https://go.dev/doc/install

This is needed to build the program.

## Obtaining the program
After installing Go, a zip file of the Marking Program should be downloaded (green Code button at the top right of the page).

Unzip the folder, navigate to “main” in the command prompt at "Marking-main\Marking-main\main”, and then type “go build”. This will generate an executable called “main.exe” which can run the program.

This can be moved anywhere and renamed.
